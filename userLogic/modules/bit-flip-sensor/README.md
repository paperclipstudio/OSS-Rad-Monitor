# OK here is the idea

The target of this module I think should have the following properties

- [] Minimal time between a bit-flip and error output ( # of clk cycles / Freqency )
- [] Minimal logical elements to reduce the area for bit-flips in the logic state
- [] Maximal number of Bits that have an effect of the output;

Also it would be nice if the following 

- [] Knowage of the location of the flip (*Fist shake* INTELLLL)
- [] Knowage of the number of bitflip that have happened in the time period (But I think this counters the first two targets)
